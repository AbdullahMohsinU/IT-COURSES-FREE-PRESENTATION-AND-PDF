<p class="calibre31"><span class="calibre8"><a></a><span class="calibre14">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span></span></p><div class="calibre32"> </div><hr class="calibre10"/><p class="calibre44">Regardless of how many editions of this book are published, they will always rest on the solid foundation created by the first edition. We remain convinced that our work has become successful because that first edition was guided by Frank Ruggirello, a former Wadsworth senior editor and publisher. Aside from guiding the book’s development, Frank also managed to solicit the great Peter Keen’s evaluation (thankfully favorable) and subsequently convinced PK to write the foreword for the first edition. Although we sometimes found Frank to be an especially demanding taskmaster, we also found him to be a superb professional and a fine friend. We suspect Frank will still see his fingerprints all over our current work. Many thanks.</p>
<p class="calibre57">A difficult task in rewriting a book is deciding what new approaches, topical coverage, and changes to depth of coverage are appropriate for a product that has successfully weathered the test of the marketplace. The comments and suggestions made by the book’s adopters, students, and reviewers play a major role in deciding what coverage is desirable and how that coverage is to be treated.</p>
<p class="calibre57">Some adopters became extraordinary reviewers, providing incredibly detailed and well-reasoned critiques even as they praised the book’s coverage and style. Dr. David Hatherly, a superb database professional who is a senior lecturer in the School of Information Technology, Charles Sturt University–Mitchell, Bathhurst, Australia, made sure that we knew precisely what issues led to his critiques. Even better for us, he provided the suggestions that made it much easier for us to improve the topical coverage in earlier editions. Dr. Hatherly’s recommendations continue to be reflected in this tenth edition. All of his help was given freely and without prompting on our part. His efforts are much appreciated, and our thanks are heartfelt.</p>
<p class="calibre57">We also owe a debt of gratitude to Professor Emil T. Cipolla, who teaches at St. Mary College. Professor Cipolla’s wealth of IBM experience turned out to be a valuable resource when we tackled the embedded SQL coverage in <a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_023.html#filepos1327332">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre57">Every technical book receives careful scrutiny by several groups of reviewers selected by the publisher. We were fortunate to face the scrutiny of reviewers who were superbly qualified to offer their critiques, comments, and suggestions—many of which strengthened this edition. While holding them blameless for any remaining shortcomings, we owe these reviewers many thanks for their contributions:</p>

<p class="calibre57">In some respects, writing books resembles building construction: When 90 percent of the work seems done, 90 percent of the work remains to be done. Fortunately for us, we had a great team on our side.</p>
<p class="calibre45">     •    We are deeply indebted to Dan Seiter for his help and guidance. The development editor is so crucial to the writing process that working with a different editor for the first time invokes a certain amount of trepidation. Dan has been everything we could have hoped for in a development editor and more. He brought fresh eyes and a new perspective that meshed wonderfully with our vision for the new edition.</p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre45">     •    After writing so many books and nine editions of <strong class="calibre14"><em class="italic">this</em></strong> book, we know just how difficult it can be to transform the authors’ work into an attractive product. The production team, both at Course Technology (Jennifer Feltri-George) and GEX Publishing Services (Marisa Taylor), have done an excellent job.</p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre45">     •    We also owe Kate Mason, our product manager, special thanks for her ability to guide this book to a successful conclusion. Kate’s work touched on all of the publication bases, and her managerial skills protected us from publishing gremlins that might have become a major nuisance. Also, her skills in dealing with occasionally cranky authors far exceed those of any diplomat we can think of. And did we mention that Kate is, quite simply, a delightful person?</p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre45">     •    Many thanks to Mark Goodin, our copyeditor. We can only imagine the level of mental discipline required to perform his job, and we salute him.</p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre57">We also thank our students for their comments and suggestions. They are the reason for writing this book in the first place. One comment stands out in particular: “I majored in systems for four years, and I finally discovered why when I took your course.” And one of our favorite comments by a former student was triggered by a question about the challenges created by a real-world information systems job: “Doc, it’s just like class, only easier. You really prepared me well. Thanks!”</p>
<p class="calibre57">Last, and certainly not least, we thank our families for their solid support at home. They graciously accepted the fact that during more than a year’s worth of rewriting, there would be no free weekends, rare free nights, and even rarer free days. We owe you much, and the dedications we wrote are but a small reflection of the important space you occupy in our hearts.</p>
