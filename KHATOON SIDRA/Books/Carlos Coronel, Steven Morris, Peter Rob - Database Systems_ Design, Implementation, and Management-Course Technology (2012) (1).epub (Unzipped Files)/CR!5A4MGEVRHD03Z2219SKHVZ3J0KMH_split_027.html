<p class="calibre9">In 1981, the Marciano brothers sold their first pair of jeans in the United States. Their idea was to combine Americans’ passion for denim with innovative, sensual European style. By 1982, their company, GUESS, boasted an annual sales growth of $6 million. By 2010, the now global company had branched out from men’s and women’s clothing into accessories like jewelry, shoes, eyewear, bathing suits, watches, wallets, and bags.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos1758831">1</a></sup> That same year, the company boasted net sales of almost $2.5 billion.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos1759268">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">A key to the company’s success is its team of designers, who work with company executives to search out global fashion trends and integrate them into the distinct GUESS image. To support this effort, the GUESS information systems department decided that the company needed a way to deliver timely business intelligence to its mobile workforce. The company has 25 regional directors in the field and 30 executives and corporate directors at headquarters. The company chose MicroStrategy, a product that could deliver mobile business intelligence through RIM BlackBerry devices.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos1759625">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">MicroStrategy Report Services conducts analysis, monitoring, and reporting. It uses a wide variety of scorecards, dashboards, and enterprise reports, and it features intuitive, self-service document creation. This tool can drill across multiple sources of data and has OLAP capabilities. The services can be delivered through a variety of mobile devices, including Blackberries, iPads, and iPhones.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos1760081">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">The GUESS database is 2 terabytes and runs on Oracle. About 500 users access it through an intranet, but different employees access the database in different ways. GUESS salespeople use their Blackberries to open PDFs and get a quick snapshot of sales to make immediate decisions. They can quickly view summarized information about margins, sales performance by region, trend information, and “pain points.” The company also extended the use of its dynamic dashboard to buyers and planners, giving these lower-level decision makers access to business intelligence. Executives and division managers access “daily flash sales” dashboards that report profitability margins, sales trends, traffic conversion, comparative store sales, or store sales this year versus last year.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The company designers are also excited about using the mobile business information system. They can use a Flash-enabled dashboard to track their products in real time. They can see how items are selling as soon as they hit the stores. They can find out if one color or design feature is outselling another. They can track buying patterns for their items and thus become more competitive and take advantage of opportunities for business growth.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The decision to adopt a mobile business intelligence system has paid off for GUESS. The year after the system was implemented, GUESS enjoyed a 20 percent increase in global sales despite the economic downturn. When many businesses were closing their doors, GUESS opened new stores in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In 2010, sales continued to grow, jumping 17 percent.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos1760439">5</a></sup> A GUESS spokesperson said, “Deploying dynamic dashboards to our traditional and nontraditional users of business intelligence was a huge opportunity for us to contribute to our revenues and global sales growth, and it wasn’t that hard to do.” Mobile business intelligence helped GUESS take the guesswork out of the decision-making process.</p>
