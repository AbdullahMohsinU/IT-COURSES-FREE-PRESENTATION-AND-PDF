<p class="calibre9">Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is a leading global shipping line. The company serves 145 countries on six continents, calling at 335 ports and providing 200 weekly liner services. Established in 1970, MSC has grown internally rather than through merger or acquisition.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos1018514">1</a></sup> The company has experienced 30 percent annual growth in recent years, and its biggest challenge is to continue providing superior services to a rapidly growing customer base. Today, the company transports over 7 million containers each year.</p>
<p class="calibre9">A key to MSC’s success is its MSCLink database, which keeps track of over 15 billion transactions per year. The 1.8-terabyte database, an internally developed application on Microsoft SQL Server, manages all aspects of the company’s business. The application database consists of a client tier, an application tier, a data tier, a reporting tier, and an analysis tier. The client software is installed in over 70 local offices around the world.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The application tier consists of a set of Visual C++ modules that interact with stored procedures. The application tier handles contracts, bookings, e-commerce, import operations, billing, electronic data interchange (EDI), auditing, equipment control and trucking management, and reporting.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos1018790">2</a></sup> By accessing the tracking module through the client tier, customers can use their MSC bill-of-lading numbers to obtain a container’s estimated time of arrival with great accuracy. Customers can also receive e-mail alerts to notify them of each movement of their containers.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos1019429">3</a></sup> The application tier also handles millions of EDI transactions per day.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The data tier contains approximately 2,000 tables and 5,000 stored procedures. The stored procedures allow the application to encapsulate SQL statements that represent a business transaction and execute them as a single transaction, thus increasing performance and reducing network traffic. The MSCLink application includes approximately 700,000 lines of stored procedure code that allows the database to support 500 million database transactions per day. MSC then synchronizes the data among its three data centers in Singapore, Geneva, and the United States.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Additionally, MSCLink generates 300 recurring reports for 400 staff members. The company runs analytics on the data warehouse and pulls stored data from MSCLink and local accounting systems. The company manages 22 terabytes of data with MSCLink.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Faster performance and 24/7 reliability is critical to MSC. Just an hour’s delay at a port can cost the company an enormous amount of money and leave customers dissatisfied. So, the tracking and EDI communication modules are mission critical. Since upgrading to the new system, the company has reported a 30 percent improvement in database performance and enjoyed uninterrupted access to its data. The company is counting on the system to accommodate its further growth.</p>
