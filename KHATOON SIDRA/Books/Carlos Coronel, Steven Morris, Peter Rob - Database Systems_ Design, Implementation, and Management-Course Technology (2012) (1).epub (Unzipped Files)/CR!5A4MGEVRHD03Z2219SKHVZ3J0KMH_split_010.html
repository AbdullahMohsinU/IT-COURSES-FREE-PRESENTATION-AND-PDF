<hr class="calibre10"/><p class="calibre9">In 1979, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who was closely following the work of researchers at IBM and the University of California at Berkeley, released the first commercial database management system (DBMS) based on the relational model. Relational databases (RDBMSs) burst on the scene in the 1980s and quickly dominated the database market.</p>
<p class="calibre9">For more than 40 years, the RDBMS industry has expanded rapidly, with Oracle maintaining its leading position. In 2010, Gartner, the leading information technology research company, reported that Oracle held a greater share of RDBMS revenue than its five closest competitors combined. In 2010, Oracle’s revenue grew 10.9 percent, ahead of the 9.9 percent industry average.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos139245">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">In 2008, a group of leading database researchers met in Berkeley and issued a report declaring that the industry had reached an exciting turning point and was on the verge of another database revolution.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos139602">2</a></sup> Over time, analysts, journalists, and business leaders have seen that new developments, such as the explosion of unstructured data in cyberspace, the growing importance of business intelligence, and the emergence of cloud technologies, may require the development of new database models.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Although relational databases meet rigorous standards for data integrity and consistency, they do not scale unstructured data as well as new database models such as NoSQL.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos139939">3</a></sup> As a result, social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook, which do not require high levels of data consistency and integrity, have adopted NoSQL databases. These types of sites are home to semistructured data such as Web logs and instant messages, giving the NoSQL model an edge in these domains. In addition, as the number of data transactions has skyrocketed in recent years, many “Big Data” companies have turned to these new data models to process their data. When Visa needed to process two years of credit transactions, the company turned to new technologies such as Hadoop to handle the 70 billion transactions; processing time was reduced from one month to 13 minutes.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos140378">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">Another technology that is fast gaining ground is in-memory databases, which store data in main memory rather than secondary storage. In-memory databases ke advantage of parallel computing and multicore processors to deliver faster business intelligence.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos140781">5</a></sup> Additionally, cloud computing provides on-demand access to clusters of computers on the Web at a reasonable cost. Cloud computing does not require that companies invest heavily in massive server infrastructure.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos141241">6</a></sup> All these technology advances are revolutionizing the database market. For example, in 2009, SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner announced that his company was taking a lead in developing in-memory databases. He said SAP was close to developing an in-memory system that could accommodate a database large enough for Walmart’s needs.</p>
<p class="calibre9">However, the relational model is not standing idly by. Today, most large relational database vendors provide in-memory database capabilities. For example, in 2005, Oracle acquired in-memory database technology with the purchase of TimesTen. Cloud computing is also enabling the widespread adoption of relational databases in organizations that could not previously afford a high-availability infrastructure. The relational model has a history of overcoming challenges from other emerging database technologies, which is why the overwhelming majority of existing systems still rely on relational databases. It remains to be seen if the relational model will evolve one more time and adapt to these new challenges. The race is on.</p>
