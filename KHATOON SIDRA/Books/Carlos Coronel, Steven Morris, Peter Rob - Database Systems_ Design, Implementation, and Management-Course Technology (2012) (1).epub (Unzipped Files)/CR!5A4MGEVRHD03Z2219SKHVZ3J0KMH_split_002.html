<hr class="calibre10"/><p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">To the treasures in my life: To Victoria, for 21 wonderful years. Thank you for your unending support, for being my angel, my sweetie, and most importantly, my best friend. To Carlos Anthony for the many good times you have given us; you show us the way. Thank you for your words of wisdom, contagious happiness, and for bringing us shining days. You are still young; your best times are still to come. To Gabriela Victoria, who is the image of brilliance, beauty, and faithfulness. Thank you for being the sunshine in my cloudy days. To Christian Javier, whose endless energy and delightful smiles keep us going every day. Thank you for being the youthful reminder of life’s simple beauties.

<p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">To Pamela, from high school sweetheart through 22 years of marriage, the beautiful love of my life who has supported, encouraged, and inspired me. More than anyone else, you are responsible for whatever successes I have achieved. To my son, Alexander Logan, whose depth of character is without measure. You are my pride and joy. To my daughter, Lauren Elizabeth, whose beauty and intensity take my breath away. You are my heart and soul. Thank you all for the sacrifices you have made that enabled me to pursue this dream. I love you so much more than I can express. To my mother, Florence Maryann, and to the memory of my father, Alton Lamar, who together instilled in me the desire to learn and the passion to achieve. To my mother-in-law, Connie Duke, and to the memory of my father-in-law, Wayne Duke, who taught me to find joy in all things. To all of you, with all my love, I dedicate this book.</span></p>

<p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">To Anne, who remains my best friend after 50 years of marriage. To our son, Peter William, who turned out to be the man we hoped he would be and who proved his wisdom by making Sheena our treasured daughter-in-law. To Sheena, who stole our hearts so many years ago. To our grandsons, Adam Lee and Alan Henri, who are growing up to be the fine human beings their parents are. To the memory of my mother-in-law, Nini Fontein, and to the memory of my father-in-law, Henri Fontein—their life experiences in Europe and Southeast Asia would fill a history book, and they enriched my life by entrusting me with their daughter’s future. To the memory of my parents, Hendrik and Hermine Rob, who rebuilt their lives after World War II’s horrors, who did it again after a failed insurgency in Indonesia, and who finally found their promised land in these United States. To the memory of Heinz, who taught me daily lessons about loyalty, uncritical acceptance, and boundless understanding. And to the memory of Sissy Mae, who defined the meaning of perfection. I dedicate this book to you, with love.</span></p>
