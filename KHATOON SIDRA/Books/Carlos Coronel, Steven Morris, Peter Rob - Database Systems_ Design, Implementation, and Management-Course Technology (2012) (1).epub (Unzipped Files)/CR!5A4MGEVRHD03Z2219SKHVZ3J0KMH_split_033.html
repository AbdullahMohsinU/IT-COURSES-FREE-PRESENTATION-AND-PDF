<p class="calibre9">Nealab is an Italian IT company that develops and manages social media sites such as <span class="italic"><a href="http://Freebar.com">Freebar.com</a></span> and IncontraGente. <span class="italic"><a href="http://Freebar.com">Freebar.com</a></span> was the first social network site established in Italy in 2003, two years prior to the social media explosion. Today, the site boasts 40,000 unique visitors and 700,000 page views per day. IncontraGente is an online dating utility with 400,000 users and about 80,000 unique visits per day. Both sites generate revenue through online advertisements and opt-in, direct e-mail marketing services.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos2379283">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">Nealab originally relied on dedicated servers and Web-hosting services to run its Webbased social media applications. However, the company has significant variability in its high-traffic Web applications,<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos2379488">2</a></sup> so its dedicated servers often did not run at full capacity and unused processing power was wasted. Cloud computing allows one physical server to host multiple logical servers in a process called server virtualization. Server virtualization maximizes the computing resources of the physical server by allocating resources to the logical servers as needed, thus reducing the number of physical machines needed to handle fluctuations in Web traffic. This virtualization allows Nealab to save time and money on server infrastructure and maintenance.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos2379831">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">Nealab decided to transition to cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Nealab runs its applications on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and it also employs Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Amazon RDS, through its cloud capabilities, makes it simple to use replication to improve database reliability and availability, and allows users to scale out beyond normal capacity during read-heavy database workloads. Furthermore, Amazon allows its clients to pay for on-demand database instances per hour. So, a company is only charged for the database processing power it actually uses.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos2380202">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">“As a Web company, we operate in a very dynamic environment that requires an elastic technological infrastructure capable of adapting to its rapid changes,” says Nealab founder Stefano Pochet. “For example, we had a high peak of traffic in December 2009 on one of our applications. During this peak, our infrastructure simultaneously ran 50 Amazon EC2 instances. Thanks to the elasticity of AWS, which has completely removed server deployment and installation processing time, we were able to manage the situation.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">Nealab can integrate its open source caching system and custom, PHP-based, object relational mapping framework with Amazon RDS. The company then employs Amazon CloudWatch to monitor its Amazon EC2 instances to provide real-time statistics and graphical views of its demand, resource usage, and performance. These cloud capabilities have enabled Nealab to run its social media platforms more effectively and efficiently; the company handles more than 6 million visitors per month through an office in the historic district of Naples with only 12 employees.</p>
