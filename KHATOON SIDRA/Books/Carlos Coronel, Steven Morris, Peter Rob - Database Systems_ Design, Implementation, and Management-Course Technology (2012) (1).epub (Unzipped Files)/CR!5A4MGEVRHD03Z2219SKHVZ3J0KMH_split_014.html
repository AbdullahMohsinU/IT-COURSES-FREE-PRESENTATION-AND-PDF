<p class="calibre9">In 1857, the Spanish Board of Trade sponsored the establishment of Banco de Bilbao, a discount and currency-issuing bank.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos410520">1</a></sup> Today, the bank, now called BBVA, is one of the most successful financial institutions in the world. It is the leading financial services provider in both the Spanish and Mexican markets and the 15th largest commercial bank in the United States. BBVA is prominent throughout South America and has large international operations in Turkey and China. The company has continued to grow and now serves more than 47 million customers with a staff of over 104,000 employees in over 30 countries.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos410860">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">Not surprisingly, the company has a wide array of information systems with a tremendous amount of data and metadata used by approximately 1,000 developers and analysts. The developers require access to corporate data when building new applications; the analysts need to perform impact analyses after introducing modifications to systems. Until recently, BBVA did not have a common repository for data information models. This made it difficult to streamline report queries, guarantee information accuracy, and provide information to business leaders in a timely fashion.<sup class="calibre56"><a href="#filepos411192">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre9">To increase the productivity of developers and analysts, BBVA decided to use Sybase Technology’s PowerDesigner to create a single repository for data model information that supports the company’s many systems.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“We had a complex environment of existing documentation with different tools and a set of already established changes to our databases,” said BBVA director of architecture Manel Crepo Rodriquez. “We needed a new data modeling tool that could integrate with our existing tools and systems without affecting their performance and roles.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">The BBVA data architects used PowerDesigner to centralize governance over all corporate data models. This centralization allowed BBVA to manage and integrate system data models consistently across its information systems and across the globe. The company’s team of architects can guarantee correct integration and review design quality. It can compare databases with models, which helps support efficient documentation and new application development.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The results have allowed BBVA to better meet its business needs. Senior managers are making strategic decisions using reports that are based on more reliable data and that can be generated faster. The entire organization has centralized access to corporate data models. As a result, porting to PowerDesigner has saved time and money in report generation and allowed the company to better serve its customers.</p>
