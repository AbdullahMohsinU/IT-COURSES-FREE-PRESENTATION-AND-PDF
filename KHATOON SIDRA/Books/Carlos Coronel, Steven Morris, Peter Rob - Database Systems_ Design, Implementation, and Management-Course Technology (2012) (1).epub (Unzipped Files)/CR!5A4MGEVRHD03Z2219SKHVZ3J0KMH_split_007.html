<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">Appendixes</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">Fifteen appendixes provide additional material on a variety of important areas, such as using Microsoft<sup class="calibre56">®</sup> Visio<sup class="calibre56">®</sup> and Microsoft<sup class="calibre56">®</sup> Access<sup class="calibre56">®</sup>, ER model notations, UML, object-oriented databases, databases and electronic commerce, and Adobe<sup class="calibre56">®</sup> ColdFusion<sup class="calibre56">®</sup>.</p>
<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">Database, SQL Script, and ColdFusion Files</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">The online materials for this book include all of the database structures and table contents used in the text. For students using Oracle<sup class="calibre56">®</sup> and Microsoft SQL Server™, SQL scripts are included to help students create and load all tables used in the SQL chapters (<a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_021.html#filepos1019753">7</a> and <a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_023.html#filepos1327332">8</a>).

<hr class="calibre10"/><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre14">INSTRUCTOR RESOURCES</strong></span></p><div class="calibre32"> </div><hr class="calibre10"/><p class="calibre53"><strong class="calibre14"><em class="italic">Database Systems: Design, Implementation, and Management, Tenth Edition</em>,</strong> includes teaching tools to support instructors in the classroom. The ancillary material that accompanies the textbook is listed below. Most of the teaching tools available with this book are provided to the instructor on a single CD-ROM; they are also available on the Web at <a href="http://www.cengage.com"><em class="italic">www.cengage.com</em></a>.</p>
<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">Instructor’s Manual</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">The authors have created this manual to help instructors make their classes informative and interesting. Because the authors tackle so many problems in depth, instructors will find the <strong class="calibre14"><em class="italic">Instructor’s Manual</em></strong> especially useful. The details of the design solution process are shown in the <strong class="calibre14"><em class="italic">Instructor’s Manual</em>,</strong> as well as notes about alternative approaches that may be used to solve a particular problem.</p>
<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">SQL Script Files for Instructors</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">The authors have provided teacher’s SQL script files to create and delete users. They have also provided SQL scripts to let instructors cut and paste the SQL code into the SQL windows. (Scripts are provided for Oracle as well as for MS SQL Server.) The SQL scripts, which have all been tested by Course Technology, are a major convenience for instructors. You won’t have to type in the SQL commands, and the use of the scripts eliminates typographical errors that are sometimes difficult to trace.</p>
<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">ColdFusion Files for Instructors</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">The ColdFusion Web development solutions are provided. Instructors have access to a menu-driven system that lets teachers show the code as well as its execution.</p>
<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">Databases</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">For many chapters, Microsoft<sup class="calibre56">®</sup> Access<sup class="calibre56">®</sup> instructor databases are available that include features not found in the student databases. For example, the databases that accompany <a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_021.html#filepos1019753">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_023.html#filepos1327332">8</a> include many of the queries that produce the problem solutions. Other Access databases, such as the ones that accompany <a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_015.html#filepos411532">Chapters 3</a>, <a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_016.html#filepos562149">4</a>, <a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_017.html#filepos747745">5</a>, and <a href="CR%215A4MGEVRHD03Z2219SKHVZ3J0KMH_split_018.html#filepos861217">6</a>, include implementations of the design problem solutions to let instructors illustrate the effect of design decisions. All the MS Access files are in Access 2000 format so that students can use them regardless of the version installed on their computers. In addition, instructors have access to all the script files for both Oracle and MS SQL Server so that all the databases and their tables can be converted easily and precisely.</p>
<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">ExamView<sup class="calibre56">®</sup></span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">This objective-based test generator lets the instructor create paper, LAN, or Web-based tests from test banks designed specifically for this book. Instructors can use the QuickTest Wizard to create tests in fewer than five minutes by taking advantage of Course Technology’s question banks, or instructors can create customized exams.</p>
<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">PowerPoint<sup class="calibre56">®</sup> Presentations</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">Microsoft PowerPoint slides are included for each chapter. Instructors can use the slides in a variety of ways—for example, as teaching aids during classroom presentations or as printed handouts for classroom distribution. Instructors can modify these slides or include slides of their own for additional topics introduced to the class.</p>
<p class="calibre54"><span class="calibre14">Figure Files</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre53">Figure files for solutions are presented in the Instructor’s Manual to allow instructors to create their own presentations. Instructors can also manipulate these files to meet their particular needs.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_7"></div></body></html>
